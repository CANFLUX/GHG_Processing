# GHG_Processing
A collection of pyhon code that can be used to unzip Smartfulx .ghg files to pull out metatdata, raw data values, and diagnostic flags.

Yet to be implemented, but the intent is to generate ini files for .ghg data and create batches of similar files (e.g. same calibrations, season, sensor separation, etc.) for submitting recalc runs to eddypro
